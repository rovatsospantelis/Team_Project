AFDE_CB7_Final_Project

The aim of the project is to develop an E-Commerce Site where the customer can buy and download online movies. The project has two parts. 
The administrator and the user-customer part. The administrator can do CRUD to movies and reply to the users' messages. 
The user can register/login, browse the movie list and communicate with the administrator. The app informs the user if he attempts
to buy the same movie twice, or if he selects to buy an unavailable movie he will be informed and prompted to select another one.

Implemented on Eclipse using the following technologies:
Spring Boot , Hibernate, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, JQuery.
